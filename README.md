IMPORTANT NOTICE:
MY CODE WILL ONLY WORK ON WINDOWS, because i'm the using (msvcrt) code, which is windows only. To use my battle loop, you need to be on a Windows device.

This is for my Digi tech NCEA Exam

So, i am making a Muisc Quiz , so far no mistakes.
I have changed my mind. Now im making a knock off pokemon game.

Used AI because while loop wasnt working 

Asked help from AI to how to randomise/shuffle things

I am avoiding copy rights by changing the name of the pokemons and chnaging the game name itself to poketmon.
I used AI to make my code look neat and tidy.
I used AI to add a play again feature in my game

Reminder:
Add colours to the replay system
Used AI because battle loop didnt work properly
